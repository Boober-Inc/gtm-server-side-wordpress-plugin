Google Tag Manager Server-Side Integration Made Easy

== Description ==

Google Tag Manager Server-Side Integration Made Easy.

This plugin lets you:

* Add Google Tag Manager Web container to your website.
* Download gtm and google analytics javascript libraries from your domain and prevent 3rd party cookie blocking.
* If you have an existing setup of GTM using another plugin it can update the settings of known plugins to use your GTM Server-Side container for tracking.
* Can send events to GTM server-side without any js library and optimize page speed.

Google Tag Manager Server-Side makes your analytics data resistant to:

* 3rd party cookies blockers (adBlockers can't block it)
* intelligent tracking protection (Safari, Firefox, etc will track all users)
* security policy restrictions (all js libraries will load from your domain)
